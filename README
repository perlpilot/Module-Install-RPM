Occasionally modules are full-blown complicated applications in their own 
right that require a little more from the operating system than a certain
set of installed perl modules.  For operating system distributions that 
utilize RPM to manage the installed packages, Module::Install::RPM provides
a mechanism for modules to require that certain rpms are installed and 
are at least at a certain version.


To install Module::Install::RPM, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
